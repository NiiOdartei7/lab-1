        <p>
            I am interested in anime, movies and video games. My favourite anime of all time is Bleach, Hunter x Hunter and Attack On Titan
            are a close second. I enjoy Christopher Nolan Movies such as Inception, Interstellar and Batman Begins. I am a huge DC Comics fan 
            although I dont enjoy the movies. My favourite game is God of War for the PS4.

            I hope to start working in game development although I do not know which part of game dev I want to work with.
            I have tried building my own games but school work and human nature slowed me down.
            Thats all about me. Thanks for reading.
