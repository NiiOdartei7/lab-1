        <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
        <h2>Database Project</h2>
        <p>
            I have created a database for a boxing promoter using MySQL. It records the names of boxers, their weight class,
            Number of fights won or lost, Venues they fought at and the amount of people that were present. It was an interesting project
        </p>

        <h2>Statistics Project</h2>
        <p>
            I did a Statistics project were a found the correlation between the wealth of voters and their preference to democracy in Africa. 
            My study found out that the richer the voter the less he preferred democracy.

        <h2>Data Structures Project</h2>
        <p>
            I wrote a program that compared the runtime for insertion in a hashtable with two different implementations. 
            One hashtable was implemented using linked lists while the other was implemented using a binary search tree
            The results were then plotted by a graph.
